# RainDrops

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h4>
RainDrop Class
</h4>

<p>
This class is a small class that has a single method for converting a number to a raindrop string. This method does so by using the modulus operator and if statements to check against specific factors. If a factor is found within that input, then a specific word will be added to the output string and any proceeding factors found, will concatenate onto the end. However, if no factors are found, then the input number will be returned as a string.
</p>

<p>It should be noted that the simple layout of the if statements means that any if there were any additional requirements that needed to be added, they could then be placed in the same location.</p>

<h4>
RainDropTest Class
</h4>

<p>
This class provides NUnit unit tests for each of the conditions, using test cases to allow multiple inputs to be tested for the same condition. These unit tests have been given descriptive names to identify what they attempt to achieve and have been broken down to ensure the purpose remains the same.
